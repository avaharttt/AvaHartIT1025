### Executive Summary
Lab 2 gives a general overview of how hardware creates the makeup of a device
### Hardware
##### Hard Drives and Memory 
Hard Drive latency is the average time it takes for the sector to rotate into poition after a completed seek. The faster it rotates, the more data passes under to be read. Hard drives only spin at one constant speed, so if the RPM is slow, there are more latencies. The transfer rate is then the speed that the data gets transferred from the actual disk around to the CPU interface. A higher rate means the faster the data will be recieved in the main memory. Solid State Drives are like a regular hard drive, but without the moving pieces and parts. Hard drives disks always have to be spinning at the right positon and can become slow. SSDs can be accessed immediatly with no latency when data is transferred.
RAM, or random access memory, is needed for a computer to run programs. Increasing RAM lets more data be loaded in as it's easier to acess than going through all the channels to reach the hard drive. At bit data path is the number of data bits thats get transferred per cycle; the more bits, the faster the transfer. A 64 bit path transfers double that of a 32 bit data path, per one cycle, making it the faster obtion.
##### ALU and the Control Unit
The CPU is like the brain, and the ALU and CU are like the heart. ALU is the Arithmetic and Logic Unit. It performs all the arithmetic and logical operations such as addition and subtraction. CU is the Control Unit. It decodes the instructions, and controls all the other internal components of the CPU to make it function correctly.
##### CPU, Input, and Output
In thhe example if a self checkout machine, the input would first be the barcodes on the products getting scanned, and having its information coverted into binary so the computer can understand. The information gets stored in order to keep the itemized list of your products. The CPU calculates all the costs, and displays them on screen. The output is what your total is, using the stored data to show you and then print a tangible reciept to keep.
##### Logic Gates and Circuits
A truth table is a visual depicting input and utput outcomes for types of logic gates. For example a NAND gate would have a input only with all outputs, an NAD gate having vise versa.
##### IEEE
The Institute of Electrial and Electronics Engineers is a global organization for engineers, scientists, and any allies in the tech field. They provide a variety of rescouces to their members who range from student age all the way to life members. The more growth that comes in the tech field, the more questions of ethics arise. Especially with topics like AI, or anything that deals with human emotion. As the text states, "AI works alongside diverse, human interests." Though, this is only treu if the inherent creators make it so. Creating perfect machines is hard enough, and when the ethics of how fair and conscious to make a new creation is hard to dicern.
### Data Representation
#### Numeric Conversions
Decimals are base 10, and used to show separation between whole numbers and their fractional counterpart. Binary numbers are all base of 2. Hexadecimal numbers are odered 1-9, A-F, using letters to represent two digits for just one component.
#### Hexadecimal Color Representation
In hexadecimal colors, each color is designated by three pairs of characters. The first pair indicates red, the second green, and the third blue. In #ab00ff, the A means 10, the B 11(, a neutral amount of green, and the blue both F=15 (255), which makes sense as it turns out to be a purple color; more blue than red and no green.
When considering accessibiliy, the color would be problematic due to its high contrast and bright in your face color. It's more shocking than appealing to a viewer and can be harsh on the eyes.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, there are many moving parts to a computer's makeup, literally and figuratively. This lab discussed the hard components, such as CPU or hard drive, the soft components like latency and intputs and binary, and how data is formed in different sectors like binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
