### Executive Summary 
Last lab we learned about cybersecurity processes and networking. This lab focuses on internet arh=chitecture and programming, including WWW and HTML!

### Internet Architecture
##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is the unique set of numbers assigned to every computer that is connected to the internet. There are two main protocals, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 is larger, letting it last much longer than its latter, IPv4. Sometimes it can lead to connectivity issues,, as some providers favor the one. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.
##### TCP/IP
The Transmisson control and Internat protocol is made for each computer in a network that has an IP address. Every IP address can then communicate for sending and receiving data to or from any other network device. Layered protocol stacks are important as they are more flexible with changes. The programs that run on the application process are SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4 and SNMP.
##### Internet Security
HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol. It is a protocol used for viewing web pages/browsers. It supports client-server model. Secure HTTP protocols for not allowing your data to be stolen by encrypting data that is being retrieved by HTTP.
##### Securing your Web Browser
Not securing your web browser can lead to hackers stealing non-encrypted information, or viruses being downloaded onto the device unknowingly. One of the risks for not securing your web browser is clicking on an ad, and then someone can hack into your computer and steal your personal information.

### Internet Programming
##### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners Lee invented the WWW, and wrote the first HTML. The W3C created a conglomerate if other technology ups to.
##### HTML5 and CSS
##### HTML and XML
### Components of a URL

### Conclusion
In this Lab we learned about internet protocals and the importance of securing your browser for yourself and others in thw network. We also learned about the foundation of the World Wide Web and how it is tied into HTML programming.
