### Internet Architecture
##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is the unique set of numbers assigned to every computer that is connected to the internet. There are two main protocals, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 is larger, letting it last much longer than its latter, IPv4. Sometimes it can lead to connectivity issues,, as some providers favor the one. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.
