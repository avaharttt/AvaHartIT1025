### Executive Summary 
Last chapter went over interent architechture and how HTML works. This chapter discusses what zip and unzip files are and what object oriented programs are.
### File Compression
A zip file is a way to store multiple files into one compressed group. This is beneficial as it takes us less space as it is a compressed file, and less time than attaching multiple files to one source on its own. When compressign my IT1025 folder it went from 606 KB to 569 KB.
### Python OOP
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class. The Shark object sammy is using the two methods swim() and be_awesome(). Constructors are a type of subroutine called to create an object, preparing the new object for use.
### Object Oriented Concepts
Class would be the business/management and objects would be menu items.
### Conclusion
 This lab discussed what compressed files are, how they work, and its advantages, as well as continues about Python works and how OOP is conjoined in it and how to use both.
